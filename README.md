# Arduino-Sonar-
Ardunio Heads up display Functional Sonar

Created with Arduino, this sonar system is extremely accurate at detecting an object's position relative to the angle of the servo motor turn as well as the distance of the object from the sensor. The heads-up display replicates a sonar and also displays the object with the color red as well as leaving a trail of where the object was.
